# This file contains most of the data which determines how we
# handle the different mime types (also see the "mimeview" file).
# Sections:
# top-level: Decompression parameters. Should not be at top-level, historical.
# [index] : Associations of mime types to the filters that translate them
#      to plain text or html.
# [icons] : Associations of mime types to result list icons (GUI)
# [categories] : groupings of mime types (media, text, message etc.)
# [guifilters] : defines the filtering checkboxes in the GUI. Uses the
#   above categories by default

## #######################################
# Decompression: these types need a first pass to create a temp file to
# work with. We use a script because uncompress utilities usually work in
# place, which is not suitable. 
#
# Obviously this should be in a [decompress] section or such, but it was
# once forgotten and remained global for compatibility. The first word
# 'uncompress' should have been the section name and has no other meaning.
# 
# The second word is the name of a script or program to execute to
# produce an uncompressed copy (e.g.: rcluncomp). It must output the
# uncompressed file name on stdout, and produce no data out of the
# temporary directory given as parameter. The uncompressed file name should
# preserve the original file extension (i.e. use gunzip myfile.doc.gz not
# gunzip < myfile.doc.gz > myfile.whateverwrongextension)
# 
# The %t parameter will be substituted to the name of a temporary directory
# by recoll. This directory is guaranteed empty when calling the filter.
#
# The %f parameter will be substituted with the input file. 
#
# Note that it should be possible to improve performance a lot by writing a
# compressor-specific script instead of the generic rcluncomp which will
# copy the compressed file into the temporary directory as a first step in
# all cases.
#

# Filters for indexing and internal preview. 
# The "internal" filters are hardwired in the c++ code.
# The external "exec" filters are typically scripts. By default, they output the
# document in simple html format, have a look at the scripts.
# A different format (ie text/plain), and a character set can be defined for
# each filter, see the exemples below (ie: msword)

# MSWORD: the rcldoc script handles a number of marginal case that raw

[guifilters]
# This defines the top level filters in the GUI (accessed by the the
# radiobuttons above the results area, or a toolbar combobox).
# Each entry defines a label and a query language fragment that will be
# applied to filter the current query if the option is activated.
#
# This does not really belong in mimeconf, but it does belong in the index
# config (not the GUI one), because it's not necessarily the same in all
# configs, it has to go somewhere, and it's not worth a separate config
# file...
#
# By default this filters by document category (see above), but any
# language fragment should be ok. Be aware though that the "document
# history" queries only know about simple "rclcat" filtering.
#
# If you don't want the filter names to be displayed in alphabetic order,
# you can define them with a colon. The part before the colon is not
# displayed but used for ordering, ie: a:zzbutshouldbefirst b:aacomeslast
