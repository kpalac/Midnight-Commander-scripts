I have been using Midnight Commander as my main destkop file manager for many years. I use it with Guake! drop-down terminal. 
This configuration came from a need for MC to be a full-blown part of desktop environment. It works well for me and saves me 
much time when working with large amounts of files of varied types, so I decide to share it. 
Perhaps it will be useful to someone.

To install run install.sh script. Use no_deps command line argument to forgo installing dependencies.
